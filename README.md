# BlitzMaxNG Grammar Definition

- *STATUS*: Incomplete

This repo contains the "Augmented Backusâ€“Naur Form" definition for the language [BlitzMax-NG](https://blitzmax.org/).

The mechanisms specified in the file are described in IETF standard [RFC5234](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5234.txt) and [RFC7405](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7405.txt)]

##Implementation
- EOL has been used to mark "End Of Line" instead of the ABNF standard CRLF for Linux/Windows compatibility
- ABNF standard for LWSP has been replaced to account for CRLF compatibility
